When the Milano XP User Group was born, in early 2006, the first thing we wanted to do was a shared Java web app project.  We learned a lot about how to set up a Java web app project.  

Since then, I keep thinking that there *should* be a good way to set up a Java web app project.  This is a collection of templates.
